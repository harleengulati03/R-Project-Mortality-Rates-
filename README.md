# R-Project-Mortality-Rates-

Analysing the yearly mortallity rate from two different hospitals in Vienesse , using maximum likelihood estimators for the mortallity rates.
Then showing, with the use of Chebyshev's inequality that with the assumption that the underlying mortallity rate is the same it is unlikely to see such a huge discrepancy between the observed mortallity rates between the two clinics. 
Thus us concluding the underlying mortallity rates are unlikely to be the same and there is a difference in the two clinics. 

A measure was then put in place for one of the clinics to improve mortallity rates : chlorine hand-washing. 
We then proceed, using a similar approach as above, to see if this intervention did indeed change mortallity rates.
We saw it most likely did.
